#How to Play
To play, simply type on the keyboard and guess the name of the weapon from the game. There are ten guesses per word, and only letters are allowed to be guessed. Incorrect letters will be displayed beneath the word blanks. There are no penalties for guessing a letter more than once.

There are a total of 65 possible words to play. Wins are counted and displayed above the weapon sprite. For easy guessing, the word and correctly guessed letters are displayed in the JavaScript console.
